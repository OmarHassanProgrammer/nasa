Internal heating: A heating system within the suit would be essential to maintain a comfortable and survivable temperature for astronauts . 2- Gas Composition:  Oxygen supply: The space suit should have a system to provide a breathable oxygen supply, as Titan's atmosphere contains very little oxygen. Methane and ethane removal: Titan's atmosphere contains methane and ethane, which are toxic to humans. The suit should include efficient air filtration and scrubbing systems to remove these gases. 3- Visibility: Clear visor: The helmet visor should provide clear visibility while protecting against dust and radiation. It may include built-in lighting for visibility in Titan's dim sunlight. 4- Pressure Control: Maintaining atmospheric pressure: The space suit must maintain a safe atmospheric pressure to prevent decompression sickness (the 'bends'). The high atmospheric pressure on Titan, about 1.5 bars, would require the suit to provide an appropriate counter-pressure"
